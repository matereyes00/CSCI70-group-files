	-> in your current terminal run the server program by typing './SALAZAR_CASANO_ICST240_SERVER <port number>' where <port>
	-> open another terminal and run the client program by
		->> changing the directory to where your extracted files are (optional)
		->> type in the terminal './SALAZAR_CASANO_ICST240_CLIENT localhost <port number>' where port number is the same specified port number for the server program

		->> open a terminal and run SALAZAR_CASANO_ICST240_SERVER.c using the similar instruction stated above.

	-> if you are the client
		->> open a terminal and run SALAZAR_CASANO_ICST240_CLIENT.c using this syntax		
		->> ./SALAZAR_CASANO_ICST240_CLIENT <IP address> <port number>' where port number is the same specified port number for the server program and IP address is the IP machine IP of the computer running the server program

::instructions
	A: commands 
		-> number keys 1 - 5				--------choose columns to drop tokens to
		-> enter key						--------drop token
	B: special inputs
		-> -1									--------force quit game
		-> 1 and 0							--------repeat or abort game upon end game prompt
		-> <your personal msg>			--------if you choose to not continue, you will be asked to send your opponent a goodbye message.,., in order to develop the spirit of camaraderie and promote world peace., =] this is in string format
	C: game play
		-> choosing a column would allow a user to drop a token to the bottom most layer of that column, unless otherwise occupied by a token previously dropped by the opponent or by the same player, in which case it'll occupy the layer above it.
		-> game ends when a player is able to tally three of his tokens either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
	D: tips
		-> diagonal winning tallies are ALWAYS hard to spot. be one the lookout for diagonals
		-> column 2 and 4 are strategic columns to put in your first tokens... =]
